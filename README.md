### About Me
I enjoy playing competitive laser tag and have been playing for 10 years. I am a member of the Laser Sports New Zealand committee and have been running Auckland leagues for 2 years. I also enjoy badminton, playing the guitar and coding. I can speak Japanese and lived in Japan for 4 years where I taught English and learnt Japanese calligraphy, guitar and coding.
